## Conclusion:

The open street map data of city of San-Fransisco is vast and detailed and encorporates various aspects of this beautiful city. Still more cleaned data can be added for the utilization of tourists. 

In this project, I have cleaned the street address and phone number data. Still post codes, city names, network, railway datas require thorough cleaning. The data of tourist attractions is quite clean and uniform but still they have some entries that will not be qualified as tourist attraction of San Fransisco. 

I did notice, standardizing the key values can help users to clean and analyze the data easily and will save a lot of time.
